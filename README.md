## Introduction

Implementation of paper - FortifyPatch: Towards Tamper-resistant Live Patching in Linux-based Hypervisor.

This work contains two prototypes: The functionality prototype, which runs on RME-enabled Arm FVP, and the performance prototype, which runs on Raspberry PI 3B+.

## Functionality Prototype
The source code of ATF and linux kernel for FVP.

## Performance Prototype
The source code of linux kernel for Raspberry PI 3B+.
